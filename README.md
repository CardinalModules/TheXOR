# The XOR - provisionally entitled the singing version uno
![modules](/res/png/modules.png?raw=true "modules")

all input and output ports are color-coded as in figure:

![legend](/res/png/legenda.png?raw=true "legend")

common characteristics:
- no user manuals, and they will never be
- ugly interface because a) i am not able and b) i am not interested in 
- totally, miserably, hopelessy free. 

this new version implements a new revision of the motherboard. the new bipolar transistors
allow negative voltages to flow, resulting in an wider range (0V to 10V or -10V to 10V).
the previous patches may sound different due to this new design. 

to add insult to injury, for the first time a plugin could have (or have not) hidden features.

# klee
a rather complete klee sequencer, with some enhancements.

# m581
inspired by the system 100 sequencer, check https://www.google.com/search?q=m185%20step%20sequencer

# renato
x/y sequencer, dedicated to the great renato!
vaguely inspired by https://www.google.com/search?q=renee%20sequencer

# z8k
4 colors x 4 sequencers. matrix reloaded.
hint: https://www.google.com/search?q=z8000%20sequencer

# spiralone
hypnotic!
based on https://www.google.com/search?q=cyclic%20sequencer

# burst
will likely cause serious damage to your ears
idea taken from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylnhftrhjnm

# pwmclockgen
some sequencers have their gate outputs dependent
from the clock pulse cycle; so here is a clock generator with controllable/swingable pwm

# quantizer
voltages in scale

# uncertain
unstable voltages
recipe:
- 1/2 doepfer a-149-1
- 1/4 buchla 266e
- 1/4 gauss sigma control
shaken, not stirred.

# att / amp
calm down your boiling voltages, or energize the cables

# boole
there are 10 kind of people: those who can understand boolean logic, and the others.
this is the first rack plugin in the world with high impedence inputs! 
use shielded cables for quieter operation.

# xswitch
circuit breaker

# mplex
multiplexer, very controllable.

# dmplex
did you multiplex? ok, now please de/multiplex.

# counter
count clocks and bangs when it reaches 0.

# midyquant
dedicated to the inventor of the short midi message. quantized midi output for heavy daw users.

# nag nag nag
trigonometric noise, a sin under control of some well-tempered voltages. 

# empty
a strategy to waste some rack space

# ascii
