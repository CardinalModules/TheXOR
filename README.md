### the absolutely awful plugin suite
![modules](/repository/modules.png?raw=true "modules")

common characteristics:
- these plugins are awful, you are advised to avoid them at all costs
- no user manuals, never ask for a user manual. 
- ugly interface because a) i am not able and b) i am not interested in user interfaces
- totally, miserably, hopelessy free
- all input and output ports are color-coded as in figure:

- warning: the millboard front panels require special screws (polygonal holes). they are easy to miss and we do not provide spares.

**** 1.1.1 update ****
i was really, really tired of the voltage level mismatch between the modules available. so, the output level 
of the sequencers changed again, now supporting a full range of -10V to +10V. this can be limited/shifted/transposed/whatever 
with two tiny knobs misleading labeled as "output range". 

to add insult to injury, for the _very first time in the world_ a plugin could have (or have not) some hidden features.
and now for something completely different: a list.

## a list.
# klee
a rather complete klee sequencer, with some enhancements. 
more information: https://www.google.com/search?q=klee%20sequencer%20pdf

# k/exp
if the complexity of a klee sequencer is not enough, use this expansion module.

# m581
inspired by the system 100 sequencer, check https://www.google.com/search?q=m185%20step%20sequencer

# renato
x/y sequencer, in memory of the great renato/04!
vaguely inspired by https://www.google.com/search?q=renee%20sequencer

# z8k
4 colors x 4 sequencers. matrix reloaded.
hint: https://www.google.com/search?q=z8000%20sequencer

# spiralone
hypnotic!
based on https://www.google.com/search?q=cyclic%20sequencer

# burst
will likely cause serious damage to your ears
idea taken from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylnhftrhjnm

# pwmclockgen
some sequencers have their gate outputs dependent from the clock pulse cycle.
here is a clock generator with controllable pwm, and swingable, and remotable, and syncable with midi, and with a lot of outputs, and frankly quite ugly.

# quantizer
voltages in scale

# uncertain
unstable voltages
recipe:
- 1/2 doepfer a-149-1
- 1/4 buchla 266e
- 1/4 gauss sigma control
shaken, not stirred.

# att / amp
calm down your boiling voltages, or energize the cables. can be used as voltage generator too.

# boole
there are 10 kind of people: those who can understand boolean logic, and the others.
this is the _very first plugin in the world_ with variable impedence inputs. 
when using high impedence mode, please use shielded cables for quieter operation.

# xswitch
circuit breaker. now expanded with optional hold capabilities.

# mplex
multiplexer, an extremely controllable one. obviously inspired by my wife.

# dmplex
did you multiplex? ok, now please de/multiplex. this sentence also inspired by my sweetie.

# counter
count clocks and bangs when it reaches 0.

# midyquant
dedicated to the inventor of the short midi message. quantized midi output for heavy daw users.

# nag nag nag
trigonometric noise, a sin () under control of some well-tempered voltages. 

# empty
a strategy to waste some rack space in a _more productive_ way ;-)

# ascii
why just taking notes if you could make them play?

# flop
as stated before, the logic consequence of using these plugins is a flop.

# qu4ttro
vaguely inspired by a popular ios app. or it was bach?

# o88o
an arpeggiator that pretends to be a sequencer, or the other way around. the first pattern is _just_ as empty as empty

# volt
the plugin that alessandro volta always wanted to have, if he was interested in microtonal music instead of frogs.

# nordschleife
for the _very first time in the world_ an analog matrix sequencer that is so complex it had to be put under CPU control.
from basic, repetitive sequences to total kaos, and everything in between. it is so complex, that cannot be used without knowing that:
1) numpad keys 0 1 2 3 / * - + can be used for data entry (when the safety car is deployed, every car shall follow)
2) every car has is own path, direction and sequence range
3) in case of collision between two cars, everything can change.
4) not to mention the step-by-step options.
