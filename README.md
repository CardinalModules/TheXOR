### The XOR - the absoultely awful plugin suite
![modules](/res/png/modules.png?raw=true "modules")

common characteristics:
- these plugins are awful, you are advised to avoid them at all costs
- no user manuals, never ask for a user manual. 
- ugly interface because a) i am not able and b) i am not interested in user interfaces
- totally, miserably, hopelessy free
- all input and output ports are color-coded as in figure:

version 1.1.x implements a new revision of the main motherboard: the new bipolar transistors
allow negative voltages to flow. all plugins have a wider range available (0V to 10V or -10V to 10V), for this the 
previous patches will sound different. 
to add insult to injury, for the very _first time in the world_ a plugin could have (or have not) some hidden features.
and now for something completely different: a list.

## a list.
# klee
a rather complete klee sequencer, with some enhancements.
more information: https://www.google.com/search?q=klee%20sequencer%20pdf

# m581
inspired by the system 100 sequencer, check https://www.google.com/search?q=m185%20step%20sequencer

# renato
x/y sequencer, in memory of the great renato/04!
vaguely inspired by https://www.google.com/search?q=renee%20sequencer

# z8k
4 colors x 4 sequencers. matrix reloaded.
hint: https://www.google.com/search?q=z8000%20sequencer

# spiralone
hypnotic!
based on https://www.google.com/search?q=cyclic%20sequencer

# burst
will likely cause serious damage to your ears
idea taken from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylnhftrhjnm

# pwmclockgen
some sequencers have their gate outputs dependent from the clock pulse cycle.
here is a clock generator with controllable/swingable pwm, and remotable and even syncable with midi start/stop pulses

# quantizer
voltages in scale

# uncertain
unstable voltages
recipe:
- 1/2 doepfer a-149-1
- 1/4 buchla 266e
- 1/4 gauss sigma control
shaken, not stirred.

# att / amp
calm down your boiling voltages, or energize the cables

# boole
there are 10 kind of people: those who can understand boolean logic, and the others.
this is the very _first time plugin in the world_ with variable impedence inputs. 
when using high impedence mode, please use shielded cables for quieter operation.

# xswitch
circuit breaker

# mplex
multiplexer, an extremely controllable one. obviously inspired by my wife.

# dmplex
did you multiplex? ok, now please de/multiplex. this sentence also inspired by my sweetie.

# counter
count clocks and bangs when it reaches 0.

# midyquant
dedicated to the inventor of the short midi message. quantized midi output for heavy daw users.

# nag nag nag
trigonometric noise, a sin () under control of some well-tempered voltages. 

# empty
a strategy to waste some rack space in a more productive way

# ascii
why just taking notes if you could make them play?
